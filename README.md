## What is WebForms Core?
WebForms Core is a framework for ASP.NET Core 8.0 or higher.

It is heavily inspired by WebForms but is not a direct port. There are many breaking changes. The goal is to provide a framework that is easy to use and offers a familiar experience for developers accustomed to WebForms.

> **Note:** This project is still in early development and is not ready for production use.

## Changes
Compared to WebForms, there are several changes:

- **NativeAOT support**  
  WebForms Core supports Native AOT compilation for .NET 8.0 (preview 2 or higher).
- **Rendering is asynchronous**  
  By default, ASP.NET Core does not allow synchronous operations. This is done [to prevent thread starvation and application hangs](https://makolyte.com/aspnet-invalidoperationexception-synchronous-operations-are-disallowed/).
- **Designer source generators**  
  WebForms Core uses source generators to generate fields for controls with an `ID`.
- **ViewState source generator**  
  In addition to using the [StateBag](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.ui.statebag), you can use the `[ViewState]` attribute on properties and fields to store them in the view state.  
- **Multiple forms**  
  WebForms Core supports multiple forms, each with its own view state, on a single page.
- **Pre-compiled views**  
  WebForms Core pre-compiles views to improve the application's startup time.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) support**  
  Experimental support for [Content Security Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-security/csp).
- **Early Hints support**  
  Experimental support for [Early Hints](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/early-hints).
- **Streaming support**  
  Similar to Blazor Server-Side, it is possible to stream HTML (without ViewState) using WebSockets.

## Installation
Create a new `.csproj` file that uses the SDK `WebFormsCore.SDK`:

```xml
<Project Sdk="WebFormsCore.SDK.AspNetCore/0.0.1-alpha.68">

    <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

In `Program.cs`, add WebFormsCore to the services and application builder:

```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddWebForms();

var app = builder.Build();

// Registers static files middleware
app.UseWebFormsCore();

// Handles .aspx files
// For example, if the URL is "/Page.aspx", it will render "Pages/Page.aspx" if it exists
app.UsePage();

// Render the page 'Default'.
app.RunPage<Default>();
```

## Global controls
In the `web.config`, you can register controls that can be used without explicitly registering them in the page or control:

```xml
<configuration>
    <system.web>
        <pages>
            <controls>
                <add tagPrefix="asp" namespace="WebFormsCore.UI.WebControls" />
                <add tagPrefix="asp" namespace="WebFormsCore.UI.HtmlControls" />
            </controls>
        </pages>
    </system.web>
</configuration>
```

## Runtime Compiler
The runtime compiler is a feature that allows you to recompile pages (`.aspx`) and controls (`.ascx`) at runtime.
As of alpha.13, the runtime compiler is not included in the SDK. This is to reduce the size of the Native AOT binaries and for security reasons.

To add the runtime compiler to your project, include the following in your `.csproj` file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <WebFormsCoreUseCompiler>true</WebFormsCoreUseCompiler>
</PropertyGroup>
```

And add the following to your `Program.cs`:

```cs
builder.Services.AddWebFormsCompiler();
```
