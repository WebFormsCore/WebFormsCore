# WebForms Core Documentation

Welcome to the WebForms Core documentation. WebForms Core is a framework for ASP.NET Core that brings the familiar WebForms experience to the modern .NET ecosystem.

## Quick Start

For a full step-by-step setup, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md).

## Why WebForms Core?

WebForms Core is designed for developers who love the component-based model of traditional WebForms but want the performance, cross-platform capabilities, and modern features of ASP.NET Core.

### Key Features

- **Native AOT support**: Built with ahead-of-time compilation in mind.
- **Asynchronous by default**: Rendering and event handling are fully asynchronous.
- **Modern Tooling**: Leverages C# Source Generators for designer files and ViewState management.
- **Performance**: Optimized for startup time and low memory footprint.
- **Familiarity**: Supports `.aspx`, `.ascx`, and Master Pages.
- **Dependency Injection**: Full ASP.NET Core DI integration.
- **Multiple Forms**: Unlike classic WebForms, supports multiple `<form runat="server">` elements per page.
